mqtt-kinesis-bridge
=====================

A simple Python-based MQTT-to-Kinesis Bridge example.

* * *
Getting Started
---------------
To get this example working with Python 2.7+, first install boto 2.23+  and paho-mqtt 0.4.91+ using: 

```
$ pip install boto
$ pip install paho-mqtt
```

and follow the instructions [here](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/getting_started.html#configuring-boto-credentials) to get your credentials setup in the AWS SDK for Python (aka. boto) for use. The
credentials you use should permit at least these Kinesis actions: `CreateStream`, `DescribeStream`, `GetRecords`, `GetShardIterator`, `ListStreams` and `PutRecord`. Both the `MergeShards` and `SplitShard` actions are unused in this example.

Then install the Mosquitto MQTT Broker by following the instructions [here](http://mosquitto.org/download/), for your OS of choice.

Once the Mosquitto broker is installed and the AWS SDK for Python is configured with your credentials, in one Terminal Window or Command Line Shell:

```
$ mosquitto
```

and then in another, run the Kinesis Bridge:

```
$ python bridge.py <stream_name>
```

which will activate the [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/) MQTT Broker and the MQTT-to-Kinesis Bridge example, respectively. The defaults for the bridge is to connect to us-east-1, however you can specify the region with the `--region` argument.

```
$ python bridge.py <stream_name> --region <region>
```

To send an example message to the MQTT endpoint that will then flow to the Kinesis stream named `<stream_name>` you should post a message to the `mqttkb` MQTT topic.

(Aside: ```mqttkb``` stands for "MQTT Kinesis Bridge")

In a third window you might run the following `mosquitto_pub` command to submit an MQTT message to the `localhost` broker:

```
$ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "mqttkb/test" -m "howdy world_00‚Äù
```

which will result in close to the following being shown in the Kinesis Bridge's
output.

```
$ python bridge.py my-first-stream
{
  "StreamDescription": {
    "HasMoreShards": false,
    "Shards": [
      {
        "HashKeyRange": {
          "EndingHashKey": "340282366920938463463374607431768211455",
          "StartingHashKey": "0"
        },
        "SequenceNumberRange": {
          "StartingSequenceNumber": "49535927568753752356407087005221112966147386710595469313"
        },
        "ShardId": "shardId-000000000000"
      }
    ],
    "StreamARN": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:123gibberish:stream/my-first-stream",
    "StreamName": "my-first-stream",
    "StreamStatus": "ACTIVE"
  }
}
